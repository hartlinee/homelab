## so what's the point?
I'm glad you asked! This homelab will help me get used to working in a more enterprise-like environment, acquaint myself with software that I may have limited or no experience with, and give me a place to play around with tools that look interesting. It is also where I'll be practicing most of my CTF skills. 

That in mind, here is my first pass at a setup for my CTF/security lab:

It is a simple setup for now, and I imagine many changes will happen over time. I'll be documenting any changes, updates, snags, and successes in this repo as I continue working and learning. 

Thanks for coming on this journey with me!
